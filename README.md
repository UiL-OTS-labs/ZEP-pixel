# ZEP-pixel
A picture selection task for Shuangshuang
## Name of the experiment pixel
The experiment in this task is all about selecting the picture that is
associated with a sound. Since it is nice to have a short name and the task
is about PICture SELection, it could be called picsel. However, picsel would
be pronounced similar to pixel, and pixel is a computer thing I decided to name
the task pixel, hence the experimental script is finally started by the
command: `zep pixel.zp`
# Introduction
As stated above the experiment is about associating pictures with auditory
stimuli. The experiment is conducted in 4 phases.
## Phase 1 learning phase
In the learning phase the participant sees one visual stimulus a picture. At The
same time the a sound is played. The sound belongs uniquely to a certain visual
stimulus, in such a way the participant associates the picture with a sound and
learns both of them belong together. There are 7 of these pairs and they
will be paired throughout the rest of the experiment. Since the order is
significant, the order of these 7 pairs randomized over participants although
all participants get the same 7 pairs. The participants should be able to replay
a given sound-picture pair. At the end 7 buttons appear, in order to replay
every stimulus until they know the pairs.
## Phase 2 practice phase
In a trial the following happens:
The participants see 4 pictures and
hear a sound after a ISI. One of the pictures should match the sound as they
are a pair according the practice phase.
All trials are presented randomly and are self paced. The trial will only,
advance to the next after the participants have responded. Before the trial
advances to the next participants are presented feedback. The feedback
comprises the marking of the correct response, since three of the pictures are
wrong.

Since reaction time is measured, participants respond with a BeexyBox, a button-
box available from www.beexy.org
## Phase 3 test phase
This phase is the same as the practice fase with the single difference that
no feedback is presented.
## Phase 4 discrimination phase
The participants see 1 picture combined with one word. They respond with a
button on the left side or on the right side, depending on whether the presented
pair is a match or a mismatch.
