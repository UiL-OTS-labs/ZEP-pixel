/**
 * About the instructions. Each instruction is a string that can contain tags
 * tags can be opened <tag> and closed </tag> if you make an accident like
 * forgetting to close a tag, zep won't display the string. Common tags are:
 * <b> bold text </b>
 * <i> italic text</i>
 * <u> underlined text </u>
 *
 * strings that contain tags, contain extra information about the MARKUP of 
 * the string. Errors regarding the markup can be detected to when you prepend
 * the string literal with an M. 
 *
 * M"This is a markup string, errors with markup text will be detected in advance"
 *  "This is a regular string literal if you make a markup error here it won't\n"
 *  "be detected."
 *
 * Remember the M"" string literal warns about invalid markup before the
 * experiment runs and the regular "" doesn't warn you about invalid markup,
 * but when it's time to display it, it just will not be shown.
